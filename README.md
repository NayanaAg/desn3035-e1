  This exercise was really helpful for me to understand the basics of GitHub quickly and efficiently. Although I have some experience with Git, it was mostly self-taught or through friends, so a lot of my knowledge is inefficient and patchy. Now that I have a better understanding of the fundamentals, I hope I'll be able to apply this information towards my personal projects as well. It was also a good way to get refamiliarized with the basics of HTML and CSS before my other courses, since it's been a while since I wrote them from scratch for a new webpage.  

  As a tool, GitHub has a lot of potential I'm excited to check out in the future. Many people use it for creating and updating games, which is what I think I'll try in my personal time.
